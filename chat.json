          "message": "Okay, for a 14-year-old presenting with a headache and no other reported symptoms:\n\n**Checklist additions/focus:**\n\n* **Detailed headache history:**  Location, duration, frequency, severity (scale of 1-10), character (throbbing, sharp, dull), associated symptoms (nausea, vomiting, light/sound sensitivity, vision changes, neck stiffness).  Consider asking about triggers (stress, caffeine withdrawal, sleep deprivation).\n* **Neurological exam:**  Focus on cranial nerves (especially II, III, IV, VI for visual disturbances),  assess for any focal neurological deficits (weakness, numbness, coordination issues).\n* **Visual acuity check:** Simple visual acuity test.\n* **Mental health screening:**  Brief screening for anxiety or depression, as headaches can be related to stress.  Consider questions about sleep, mood, and school performance.\n* **Review of systems:**  Briefly inquire about other symptoms, even if not directly related (fever, recent illness, trauma, changes in vision or hearing).\n\n**Documentation additions:**\n\n* **Record the detailed headache history mentioned above.**  Use a standardized pain scale (e.g., 0-10).\n* **Note the findings of the neurological exam, specifically addressing cranial nerves and any neurological deficits.**\n* **Document visual acuity assessment.**\n* **Record the results of any mental health screening.**\n* **Specify absence of fever, rash, stiff neck, etc.**\n* **Differential Diagnosis (for your consideration, not for documentation):**  Tension headache, migraine, sinus headache, stress-related headache.  Less likely, but consider:  brain tumor (if headache is progressively worsening or new-onset), subarachnoid hemorrhage (if severe sudden onset), meningitis (if accompanied by fever and stiff neck).\n\n**Screening Questions (adapt as needed):**\n\n* \"Can you describe the headache for me? Where is it located? How long has it been going on?\"\n* \"Is it a throbbing pain, or something else?\"\n* \"Does anything seem to trigger the headaches?\"\n* \"Do you experience nausea or vomiting with the headaches?\"\n* \"Are you sensitive to light or noise when you have a headache?\"\n* \"How would you rate the pain on a scale of 0-10, with 0 being no pain and 10 being the worst pain imaginable?\"\n* \"How is school going?  Are you feeling stressed?\"\n* \"How's your sleep been lately?\"\n\n\nRemember to defer to your clinical judgment.  This information is for support only.  If the headache is severe, worsening, or accompanied by concerning symptoms, further investigation is needed.\n",
